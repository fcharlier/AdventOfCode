== DISCLAIMER

Using a sligtly improved algorithm base on pt1.py, I managed to get 100 moves done in
about 0.5s (initially) increasing to 3s around 300k rounds, that was not going to fit as
a solution. Too much data moving around behind the scenes.

Out of ideas this time I went to search for ideas on /r/adventofcode and realized that
a linked list was the way to go.

Rather than storing values in a list/array and rearranging them in memory, we instead
need to know for each value not its position (in a list) but which is the next value.
This way to pop or insert values after a certain value, we just need to change the
"next" one, which is only about writing a big value, but surely not moving large amounts
of data around.

So this is sadly not an algorighm which popped out of my head, but once I got the idea I
still wrote it by myself.
