    However, the problem sould be veirified onlu for our specific set of rules.
    We can see that rule 0 is: 8 11 (oh, our two rules â€¦)
    8 is: 42 | 42 8, reduced to one or more times rule 42
    11 is: 42 31 | 42 11 31, reduced to one or more times 42 and as many times 31
    That's all we need to solve for now, match rule 42 as much as we can and verify that
    we can match rule 31 at lease one more time.

    I've struggled a lot with this one trying to make it work with a "generic" algorithm
    and then struggling again with index errors for this solution which I don't like at
